# PRODIGY_ML_02
This project is my second internship task at Prodigy Infotech, where I implemented KMeans clustering using Python and scikit-learn to segment mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. I began by exploring and cleaning the dataset to ensure data quality. Using the Elbow Method, I determined that the optimal number of clusters was five. I then trained a KMeans model to group customers into distinct clusters, revealing meaningful customer behavior patterns such as high income–low spending and low income–high spending segments. The results were visualized using Matplotlib to clearly illustrate the customer groups.
